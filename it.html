Computer Engineering Role in Pandemic COVID-19!
The problem of how computers can help monitor the COVID-19 pandemic is being put to artificial intelligence ( AI) experts worldwide
</p>
<p>
The AI tools can be of assistance in many different ways. 
They are used to predict the spread of coronavirus, map its genetic evolution as it transmits from human to human, speed up diagnosis and potential development of treatment, as well as help policy makers address related issues such as the impact on transportation, food supply and travel
</p>
<p>
But in both of those cases artificial intelligence is only useful if it has enough examples to learn from. 
As COVID-19 has brought the world to unchartered territories, the "deep learning" systems that computers use to develop new skills do not in fact have the data they need to deliver useful outputs.

The COVID-19 pandemic, also known as the coronavirus pandemic, is an ongoing pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‑19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‑CoV‑2). The outbreak was first identified in Wuhan
</p>
<p>
in December 2019. The World Health Organization declared the outbreak a Public Health Emergency of International Concern on 30 January, and a pandemic on 11 March. As of 31 May 2020, more than 6.11 million cases of COVID-19 have been reported in more than 188 countries and territories, resulting in more than 370,000 deaths; more than 2.59 million people have recovered

The virus is primarily spread between people during close contact,most often via small droplets produced by coughing, sneezing, and talking. The droplets usually fall to the ground or onto surfaces rather than travelling through air over long distances
</p>
<p>
 Less commonly, people may become infected by touching a contaminated surface and then touching their face. It is most contagious during the first three days after the onset of symptoms, although spread is possible before symptoms appear, and from people who do not show symptoms
</p>
<p>
Common symptoms include fever, cough, fatigue, shortness of breath, and loss of sense of smell.Complications may include pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome.The time from exposure to onset of symptoms is typically around five days but may range from two to fourteen days.There is no known vaccine or specific antiviral treatment.Primary treatment is symptomatic and supportive therapy.
</p>
<p>
The pandemic has caused global social and economic disruption,including the largest global recession since the Great Depression.It has led to the postponement or cancellation of sporting, religious, political, and cultural events,widespread supply shortages exacerbated by panic buying,and decreased emissions of pollutants and greenhouse gases.Schools, universities, and colleges have been closed either on a nationwide or local basis in 177 countries, affecting approximately 98.6 percent of the world's

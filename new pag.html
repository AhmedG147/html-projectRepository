Using facial recognition technologies, artificial intelligence can help to recognize the location of existing covid 19 virus ceels on the human body, and neural netwok can also be avoided or attempted to learn the available treatment from the netwok and avoid increased covid 19 cells on the human body.

Scientists and researchers use supercomputers known internationally as "super computers" to speed up the quest for a cure for the Corona virus, which has invaded the world in the case of closed and disrupted social , economic and commercial life.
<p>
Researchers at University College London are saying supercomputers within days thanks to data processing which can take months to normal.
It means that it allows "potential antiviral drug repositories" to be tested and handled very easily, including medicines already approved to treat certain diseases, according to a study published in the British newspaper "Daily Mail.'

A recent review of the MIT suggests "health awareness maps," illustrating associations between symptoms and diseases and intended to assist with clinical diagnosis, may be short for some disorders and groups of patients.
The findings also suggest ways of boosting their performance.

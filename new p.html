Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is a newly discovered coronavirus-caused infectious disease. 
Most people infected with the COVID-19 virus will experience mild to moderate respiratory illness and recover without requiring special treatment. Older people and those with underlying health problems such as cardiovascular disease , diabetes, chronic respiratory disease and cancer are more likely to develop severe illness. 
</p>
<p>
Being well informed about the COVID-19 virus, the disease it causes and how it spreads is the best way to prevent and slow down transmission. Protect yourself and others from contamination by washing your hands or regularly using a rub dependent on alcohol, and not touching your nose.
</p>
<p>
When an infected person coughs or sneezes, the COVID-19 virus spreads primarily through droplets of saliva or discharge from the nose, so it is important that you also practice respiratory etiquette (for example, by coughing into a flexed elbow). 
</p>
<p>
There are no specific COVID-19 vaccines or treatments present at this time. There are however many ongoing clinical trials evaluating potential therapies. As soon as clinical findings become available WHO will continue to provide updated information.
